            Shadow Milk Cookie was first introduced as a non-playable character to CRK in the 3rd
            anniversary update
            <i>Secrets of the Silver Kingdom,</i> released January 19th 2024. As one of the
            first<span class="footnote">
              Fans often assume they were <i>the</i> first, but context suggests they were a remedy
              to pre-existing turbulence and some

              also makes this idea otherwise dubious.

            cookies to be granted life by Earthbread's "Godly Creators", Shadow Milk once served as
            the graceful and benevolent Fount of Knowledge for all of cookiekind to seek out wisdom
            from. However, after growing disillusioned and spiteful over how cookies rejected his
            Truths to instead cling to more "palatable" falsehoods, he would cast aside his role as
            a divine emissary to instead embrace the spread of Deceit - and it was through this
            corruption of both his values and Soul Jam<span class="footnote"
              >The physical vehicle that his virtue (and later its corrupted form) resides within.
              To this end, all forms of Soul Jam and their associated virtues are regarded as
              (sentient?) forces of nature that can be wielded by their owners as incredibly
              powerful forms of magic, and Soul Jam is intrinsically connected to the
              lifeforce/willpower of it's wielder in turn.</span
            >
            that he was reborn into a vicious and unpredictable puppetmaster, stringing together
            lies to cause upheaval across Earthbread for his own entertainment.
          </p>

          <p>
            This heel-turn into chaos and destruction was met with divine retribution by way of his
            Soul Jam being split between its corrupted form of Deceit and purer form of Truth, as
            well as him being subject to indefinite imprisonment within the Silver Tree alongside
            his fellow former emissaries - and thus did the Beast cookies collectively fade from
            cookiekind's memory as a silently forgotten evil, while the untainted halves of their
            virtues were resdistributed to a new brigade of heroes who earned their power through
            tests of worth (as opposed to birthright).

            before the events of the main story), Shadow Milk would be the first Beast to introduce
            himself to the protagonists after they failed to protect the Silver Tree's degrading
            seal - and included in their number was the cookie who just so happened to have been

            As the walking embodiment of lies, Shadow Milk Cookie's modus operandi rests in
            disorienting others as much as possible - a majority of his screen time during
            <i>Theater of Lies</i> is spent giving a rolling commentary that belittles the main
            ensemble, casts doubt upon the trustworthiness of their allies, and attempts to distract
            all parties from the fact he's just set an entire kingdom ablaze. Befitting of his
            harlequin image, his favorite method of disarming his opposition lies within mocking
            illusions and outlandish declarations - yet for how absurd his games may seem, one
            cannot help but wonder if there really <i>is</i> a sliver of truth to his words.<span

              >His posturing as this nigh-untouchable "god of magic" could possibly be likened to
              how real world court jesters of the Middle Ages were often formally employed
              entertainers to aristocracy, who by way of Jester's Privilege could freely criticize
              authority and deliver harsh truths without fear of reprisal - after all, who would
              ever take the words of a fool seriously?</span

            Despite his relatively open-and-shut presence in the story at the time, Shadow Milk
            would quickly become the subject of an explosive amount of positive feedback, fandom
            speculation, and requests from the playerbase to one day be made into a playable
            character<span class="footnote"

            In a bid to take back the "stolen" half of his Soul Jam from his successor, Shadow Milk
            lures the Ancient hero Pure Vanilla and his young companions into his personal domain,
            the Spire of All Knowledge - an initially tranquil and elegant tower that quickly warps
            into a chaotic and unending maze that twists and reforms at the whims of it's master; as
            if the very environment itself was hellbent<span class="footnote"
              >Given how Shadow Milk repeatedly references the spire as an extension of himself
              (especially in the original Korean text), this idea may not be all that far off,
              though that of course depends on how literally you take his words.</span

            on keeping the ensemble trapped within its walls. It is upon this stage that Shadow Milk
            enacts his plan to whittle away at Pure Vanilla's resolve to in turn defeat him: Holding
            a mirror up between himself and this so-called "other half" of Knowledge, and spelling
            clear just how similar <i>his</i> past life was to Pure Vanilla's present one - in his
            eyes, the hero of Truth is outright destined to follow in his footsteps of loss, despair
            and corruption, so he might as well just <i>give into it.</i>

            It is only after conceding to Shadow Milk's cruel deceptions<span class="footnote"
              >As in: actively altering Pure Vanilla's memories and gaslighting him into believing
              that Shadow Milk has been with him over the entire course of his life. While Pure
              Vanilla eventually discovers this to be false, outside evidence still suggests that
              he's legitimately been observing him since the events of the game's prologue.</span

            and fully embracing Deceit, however, that Pure Vanilla is able to flip the mirror back
            around and shine a light upon the Truth that hides behind the Beast of Deceit's
            performative mask: At the heart of his character, Shadow Milk Cookie is
            <i>profoundly</i> a lonely cookie, and it is because of this heavily repressed desire
            for connection - for someone to truly <i>see</i> him - that he has turned to his persona
            of a maniacal, disgraced deity who violently lashes out at those who he cannot perfectly
            predict and control. It becomes hard not to read his attempts to drag the first cookie
            who could possibly relate to his struggles down to his level as a cry for help, under
            such pretenses.

            and flees from Pure Vanilla with the simple promise that they <i>will</i> meet again. As
            it currently stands in the narrative, Shadow Milk stands at a crossroads between working
            for a villainous superior that he doesn't appear to back the goals of (nor trust the
            methods of), versus turning and embracing Truth and understanding at the cost of an
            unthinkable amount of vulnerability. When the Call of Destiny comes for that final
