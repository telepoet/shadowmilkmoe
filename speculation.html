          <h2>The Fount of Knowledge</h2>
          <p>
            Inarguably the most heavily debated aspect of Shadow Milk's character is his past
            identity as a divine emissary, known only as the Fount<span class="footnote"
              >Curiously enough, this is in contrast to the naming pattern that the rest of the
              emissaries share where their ingredient is used as a descriptor for their virtue (see:
              Sugar of Happiness, Salt of Solidarity, Flour of Volition; Burning Spice also follows
              this convention, though for some reason it's absent in the English translation).
              Whether or not this is meant to imply anything about Shadow Milk's relationship to his
              core ingredient is entirely unclear, I just find it interesting.</span
            >
            of Knowledge. Compared to his other Beast peers, everything from the precise cause of
            the Fount's downfall to his <i>appearance</i
            ><span class="footnote"
              >You can tell I started working on this before December 16th, 2025.</span
            >
            has been heavily obfuscated both in and out of the game, so much so that his absence
            teeters the edge of haunting the narrative<span class="footnote"
              ><i>Overly Sarcastic Productions</i> has a
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZkxpGYHJpM" target="_blank"
                >fantastic video</a
              >
              that explains this writing trope, but the short definition can more or less be summed
              up as "a character of major narrative significance, but (something in) the plot can't
              happen if they're
              <i>actually there."</i>
            </span>
            outright. This is not to suggest that cookies in the know (namely Shadow Milk himself)
            are unwilling to discuss the Fount of Knowledge's existence; rather the details have
            only come in broad strokes and with a blatant wink-nudge to the player that serves to
            imply that the finer details are being withheld for reasons of bigger scope than just
            fitting the character's themes of obfuscation and uncertainty.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even in spite of his upcoming Dominion of The Beasts segment, his character (or lack
            thereof) remains celebrated across the fandom as something of a wild card in the game's
            lore, heavily varied in interpretation and oft-regarded as distinctly seperate from his
            future-present self. He's basically a psuedo-original character that all manner of
            artists and writers in the fandom like to take the basic premise of and then run in
            wildly different directions with - whether or not these interpretations are fated to
            collapse in on themselves once we actually get a glimpse of his character remains to be
            seen.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h2>Relationship to the Witches</h2>
          <p>
            One of the things I find most personally interesting about Shadow Milk's behavior and
            characterization is his fixation upon the Witches, especially when contrasted against
            the opinions held by the rest of the Beasts. Far and away, he expresses the most amount
            of disdain for their creators, to the extent of actively calling for their downfall and
            becoming aggressive whenever they're discussed by other cookies, believing them to be
            the primary cause for his suffering.<span class="footnote"
              >Minding, of course, that <i>all</i> of them are unaware of a rather crucial detail
              about their imprisonment in the Silver Tree. If you know, you know.
            </span>
            However, a few cases of offhand commentary from the Beast gives reason for pause and
            further scrutiny, such as:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            &#x1F676; First, I want to hear what that Cookie has to say.<br />
            We decide what to do after. &#128631;
            <br />
            <small>- Silent Salt Cookie </small><br /><br />
            &#x1F676; Ha ha! That's what noble knights do–won't spill a droplet of blood without
            good reason. Oh, wait! We, Cookies, have no blood... What do we have again? &#128631;
            <br />
            <small>- Shadow Milk Cookie (Abyss of The Four)</small>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Even in context, him evoking a distinctly human term (and then making a show of
            correcting himself) is pretty much a total non-sequitur, and the only thing it really
            serves to demonstrate is that Shadow Milk is familiar with some of the differences in
            biology between cookiekind and their creators. This line sticks out SO much from the
            rest of <i>Abyss of The Four</i> that I've been ruminating on it's implications since
            the update came out. There are a couple ways it could later prove relevant: In my mind,
            this unique habit of breaking out human terminology serves to back the theory that he's
            aware of the truth behind cookiekind's existence (in that they are created to be eaten),
            and/or was at some point close enough with the Witches during his time as an emissary to
            have gained Knowledge of what makes them different from cookies, under more innocent
            pretenses.<br /><br />
            Either conclusion makes his present day disdain all the more intriguing; does his hatred
            run deeper than <i>just</i> them imprisoning him? Did he, perhaps, once harbor a more
            personal and involved connection with these almighty beings that created him?
            Regardless, given that he's often alone in his expressions of resentment - and is
            typically the first Beast to immediately recognize the Witches' influence and power<span
              class="footnote"
              >Such as when Dark Enchantress revealed herself to be capable of wielding Baking
              Magic, which by his word as the <i>primordial master of magic</i> should be impossible
              for a cookie to achieve.</span
            >
            - it's not all that far off of a guess that he knows something about them that the rest
            of the Beasts don't.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h2>The Blueberry Yogurt Academy</h2>
          <p>
            Another implied connection stems from the backstories of both Pure Vanilla Cookie and
            White Lily Cookie, during their shared time together as students at the now-abandoned
            Blueberry Yogurt Academy, showcased in World Exploration 7 and 8. Beyond the school
            sharing a multitude of visual motifs and aesthetics with the Shadow Milk-focused levels
            of Beast Yeast,<span class="footnote"
              >See: Very similar blue-toned color palettes, Baroque-esque architecture, a wide
              variety of milk and cream-based enemies and set pieces, and chess motifs. Shadow Milk
              himself also has some elements that conversely evoke the image of blueberries (namely
              the Yogurt River of Rebirth and his very own magic staff), and a design insight panel
              held at the 4th Anniversary popup convention in South Korea moreover showcased that
              there was a period during development where Shadow Milk's (near-final) design was
              based entirely upon them as "Blue Beetle Cookie".
            </span>
            flashback dialogue between the young Ancients serves to suggest that Shadow Milk himself
            might have had involvement in the school in ages past - more specifically, the
            broad-sweeping implication that he was the school's
            <i>first headmaster.</i>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <img src="images/Chapter_8_cutscene_item_1.webp" style="width: 50%" /><br />
            &#x1F676; Do you see the first headmaster's portrait over there?<br />
            Wise, brilliant...<br />
            The first headmaster taught the Cookies how to use magic. &#128631;
            <br />
            <small>- White Lily Cookie (Hall of Enlightenmnet)</small>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Not only does this single declaration alone <i>perfectly align</i> with our
            understanding of the Fount of Knowledge's own magical prowess and role as an emissary,
            but this dually leaves us with some <i>fascinating</i> questions about just how deep
            Shadow Milk's influence truly runs in the life (and rebirth) of White Lily Cookie,
            specifically.<br /><br />Regardless of how direct (or even intentional) the influence
            was, the impact the Yogurt Academy and the contents of its forbidden archives have had
            are undeniable: White Lily's pursuit of <i>Knowledge</i> - for answers to the truth
            behind cookiekind's existence - not only pushed her to use Dark Moon Magic during her
            academy days (which is what brought about the destruction of the school to begin with),
            but also acted as the catalyst for Dark Enchantress Cookie's very existence later down
            the line,
