            <blockquote>
              Now, I tend to dislike Beast redemption arc works for the myriad mischaracterization
              pitfalls that tend to come with them, but not only is <i>Chiaroscuro's</i> twist on
              the premise <i>incredibly</i> on the nose, but the plot progression throughout remains
              snappy without compromising on buildup. The variety of character dynamics that get
              explored outside of the primary slash pairing keeps things refreshing, and the plural
              representation is a super intriguing take on Shadow Milk's character that's handled
              with tact. It should be telling that this is the primary fic on this list that I've
              already completed multiple rereads of.

              Wherein FaeMytho launches canon SMPV and <i>Diverged</i> SGTR at each other like
              Barbie dolls to some mildly terrifying results; <i>Spirepeak</i> remains far and away
              my favorite interpretation of both the Sage of Truth and Truthless Recluse in the
              entire fandom, and that's not even getting into the series of misunderstandings that
              rapidly cascades into the worlds funniest love square. An extremely well executed
              plotline with some great worldbuilding and tons of fun Deceit Trio & Bravegang content
              inbetween.

            <blockquote>
              One of my favorite examples of Apollo's Gift of Prophecy in a fanwork, the entirety of
              <i>Echo Paradox</i> was written long before much of the dynamics and theories it
              touches upon were canonized. Ergo, this fic has a large smattering of speculative
              energy and canon divergence present, but I implore you to put yourself in the shoes of
              a 2023 era fandom member who got to see almost all of the subject matter here get
              actualized in the game a little under a year later. A fascinating time capsule into
              the fandom's premier approach to Shadow Milk's background and fixation upon his other
              half.<br /><small

                over a reverse-chronological tumblr tag, but I won't be linking to it here as it
